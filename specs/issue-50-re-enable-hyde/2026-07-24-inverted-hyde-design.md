# Inverted HyDE: Index-Time Query Generation

**Issue:** Hortora/engine#50
**Date:** 2026-07-24
**Status:** Approved

## Context

HyDE (query-time hypothetical document generation) was benchmarked twice and is definitively net-negative for this corpus (-2.2pp precision in both double-retrieval and single-retrieval modes). The root cause, confirmed by Weller et al. (EACL 2024), is that generative query/document expansion harms strong retrievers — expansion improves recall but adds noise that degrades ranking precision among top candidates.

This spec supersedes the prior design (`2026-07-23-re-enable-hyde-design.md`), which proposed re-enabling query-time HyDE via config change. That approach was implemented and benchmarked on 2026-07-23, producing the -2.2pp results above. Issue #50's acceptance criteria should be updated to reflect this pivot from query-time to index-time expansion — the original criteria (re-enable config, per-leg separation dependency) no longer apply.

Inverted HyDE flips the approach: instead of generating hypothetical *documents* from queries at query time, generate hypothetical *queries* from documents at *index time*. This grounds the expansion in actual corpus content and eliminates the query-time latency penalty. The generated queries bridge the vocabulary gap between how developers search and how garden entries are written.

### Prior benchmark results (this branch)

| Config | File | Precision | Delta vs baseline |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| No HyDE (baseline) | `crossencoder-pool50-scored.json` | 61.6% | — |
| Double-retrieval HyDE | `hyde-perleg-separation.json` | 59.4% | -2.2pp |
| Single-retrieval HyDE | `hyde-single-retrieval.json` | 59.4% | -2.2pp |

## Approach

**Content augmentation with separator — engine-only, no neocortex changes.**

### Architecture: decorator pattern

`GardenMetadataExtractor` remains a pure extraction function — it parses YAML frontmatter, extracts metadata, and produces `ExtractionResult` with no side effects.

A new `QueryAugmentingExtractor` wraps `MetadataExtractor` via CDI decorator, separating extraction from augmentation. `CorpusBindingProducer` injects `MetadataExtractor` via CDI constructor injection, so the decorator is automatically applied to the ingestion pipeline. The decorator:

1. Delegates to the real extractor (`GardenMetadataExtractor`)
2. If inverted HyDE is enabled and `ExtractionResult.body` is non-empty, generates queries via `OllamaQueryGenerator`
3. Reads/writes sidecar `.queries` cache (using `GardenConfig.path()` for filesystem access)
4. Appends queries to `ExtractionResult.body` with a separator
5. Returns the augmented `ExtractionResult`
6. If Ollama is unavailable, returns the original result unchanged

The decorator is conditionally active based on `hortora.inverted-hyde.enabled`.

### Query generation

`OllamaQueryGenerator` calls a local Ollama instance (gemma3:4b) with a domain-tuned prompt:

```
Given this knowledge garden entry about JVM development, generate exactly 3 short questions
that a developer would type into a search box to find this entry.
Use the same technical vocabulary the entry uses — class names, annotations, error messages.
One question per line, no numbering, no explanations.
```

Input: entry title + first ~500 chars of body. Output: 3 lines of query text.

**Why Ollama, not AgentProvider:** Index-time augmentation runs on every garden entry (~2000+ on full reindex). Claude API calls at $0.003–0.015 each would cost $6–30 per full reindex; local Ollama inference costs nothing. Query generation is a simple task — a 4B parameter model is sufficient. Local inference also avoids a hard dependency on Vertex AI credentials, which may not be available in all environments (local dev, CI). `AgentProvider` is designed for interactive session-based LLM use; a stateless one-shot HTTP call to Ollama is the right abstraction for batch index-time processing.

### Content augmentation

Generated queries are appended to `ExtractionResult.body` with a separator:

```
[original content — title + body]

---HYPOTHETICAL-QUERIES---
How does @DefaultBean interact with @Produces in Quarkus?
Why does CDI ignore @DefaultBean on class-level annotations?
What pattern enables consumer-replaceable CDI defaults?
```

BGE-M3 embeds the full combined text. Dense, sparse, BM25, and ColBERT all pick up the query vocabulary. The hypothesis: sparse/BM25 benefit most from vocabulary bridging, dense benefits less (consistent with Weller et al.'s finding that expansion helps recall more than precision). Note: Weller et al. study query-time expansion; index-time content augmentation has a different failure mode (permanent index vocabulary addition vs. transient query noise), but the finding about recall vs. precision generalises.

**Chunking interaction:** The garden corpus uses recursive chunking (max 6000 chars, 500 overlap). Most garden entries are well under 6000 chars including augmented queries (~3 queries × ~80 chars = ~240 chars + separator), so they remain single-chunk. For the rare multi-chunk entry, queries append to the tail and may land in a later chunk — this is acceptable because that chunk retains the same `sourceDocumentId` and still contributes to the entry's discoverability via all retrieval signals. If corpus sizes grow significantly, augmentation can be moved post-chunking via a neocortex `ContentAugmenter` SPI (future work).

### Sidecar caching

Generated queries are cached in `.queries` files alongside each garden entry:

```
~/.hortora/garden/jvm/GE-20260515-fd3156.md       ← entry
~/.hortora/garden/jvm/GE-20260515-fd3156.queries   ← cached queries
```

One query per line, plain text. Regeneration logic:
- `.queries` exists and entry `.md` is not newer → use cached (no LLM call)
- `.queries` missing or `.md` is newer → generate via Ollama, write cache

Files are local artifacts, not checked into the garden repo (`*.queries` in `.gitignore`).

### Display stripping

`SearchResource.searchLocal()` strips the `---HYPOTHETICAL-QUERIES---` section from `chunk.content()` before passing it as the `body` parameter of `SearchResult`. All search paths (`search()`, `searchFor()`, `searchAdaptive()`) flow through `searchLocal()`, so stripping covers all return paths.

**Cross-encoder interaction:** The cross-encoder reranker evaluates `chunk.content()` before stripping — it sees the augmented content including hypothetical queries. This is intentional: the hypothetical queries provide additional signal about what the document is about, which helps the cross-encoder assess relevance. Since all entries are uniformly augmented, relative rankings are preserved. Selective augmentation of only the dense embedding (without cross-encoder influence) requires the separate named vectors approach (out of scope, see #53).

**Fusion key:** `RetrievedChunk.fusionKey()` is `sourceDocumentId + "\0" + content`. During the transition from non-augmented to augmented index, entries may have inconsistent fusion keys. A full reindex (`gardenReindex()`) after enabling inverted HyDE eliminates this — all entries get uniform augmentation.

### Graceful degradation

If Ollama is unavailable (not running, model not pulled):
- `QueryAugmentingExtractor` logs a warning and returns content without augmentation
- Entries are indexed normally — same as current baseline
- Tests: `InMemoryEmbeddingIngestor` doesn't embed, so no impact

**Deployment:** After enabling inverted HyDE, run `gardenReindex()` to augment all existing entries. Without this, only newly modified entries get queries, resulting in a mixed index with no automated convergence path. `gardenReindex()` deletes the Qdrant collection and resets the cursor; the next ingestion cycle re-embeds all entries with augmented content.

### Configuration

```properties
# Inverted HyDE — local query generation via Ollama
hortora.inverted-hyde.enabled=true
hortora.inverted-hyde.ollama.host=http://localhost:11434
hortora.inverted-hyde.ollama.model=gemma3:4b
hortora.inverted-hyde.query-count=3
```

## Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `QueryAugmentingExtractor` (new) | CDI decorator on `MetadataExtractor` — orchestrates query generation and content augmentation |
| `OllamaQueryGenerator` (new) | Ollama HTTP client for query generation |
| `GardenMetadataExtractor` | Unchanged — remains pure extraction |
| `SearchResource` | Strip `---HYPOTHETICAL-QUERIES---` section from `chunk.content()` in `searchLocal()` before constructing `SearchResult` |
| `SessionQueryExpander` | Remove — query-time HyDE is definitively closed by benchmarks |
| `SessionQueryExpanderTest` | Remove |
| `application.properties` | Add inverted HyDE config; remove commented-out expansion config and DISABLED comment |
| `pom.xml` | HTTP client dependency for Ollama API (if not already present) |

## Verification

Re-run the existing benchmark harness (`scripts/benchmark/`) against all 14 real-world scenarios.

**Comparison:**
- **Baseline:** `crossencoder-pool50-scored.json` (no HyDE, current pipeline)
- **Treatment:** inverted HyDE (augmented content, same pipeline)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Zero precision regressions on any individual scenario
- Aggregate precision improvement ≥ +1pp across all 14 scenarios
- At least 1 scenario shows ≥ +2pp improvement (demonstrates signal, not noise)
- Latency: no query-time overhead expected (augmentation is index-time only)

**Non-determinism:** Query generation is cached in sidecar `.queries` files, so augmented content is stable across benchmark runs. Embedding (ONNX) and retrieval (Qdrant NN) are deterministic given the same input. Multiple runs are not needed.

**Rollback:** Qdrant snapshot `hortora_garden-2913056546253732-2026-07-24-03-04-39.snapshot` restores the baseline index. No re-indexing needed.

### Testing

Unit tests for:
- `QueryAugmentingExtractor` — delegation to real extractor, content augmentation with/without queries, disabled state
- `OllamaQueryGenerator` — sidecar cache read/write/staleness detection
- `SearchResource` — stripping logic for the separator in `searchLocal()`

No integration tests against Ollama — graceful degradation means tests run without it.

## Known Limitations

- **Federation asymmetry:** Remote gardens that don't implement inverted HyDE won't have vocabulary-bridging queries in their index. Local augmented entries have a systematic vocabulary advantage in federated results. Each garden controls its own ingestion pipeline; federation-level consistency is a separate concern.

## Out of Scope

- Separate named vectors for query embeddings (approach C — graduate to this if A works) — #53
- Expansion drift detection (#118/#120 — complementary but independent)
- LLM quality evaluation framework (manual sampling for now) — #54
- Query-time HyDE re-enablement (definitively closed by benchmarks)
